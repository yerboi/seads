# Installing SEADS #

Installing the **Source Engine Automatic Demo Saver** is now even simpler with Version 3.10.

SEADS utilizes a two-stage automated installer; extract and run SEADS\_Setup.msi, then follow the instructions to choose an installation folder for SEADS.  After SEADS has been installed, it will automatically scan for available Source Engine games and enable SEADS support.
