# Using SEADS #

Using the Source Engine Automatic Demo Saver is easier than ever before; simply follow the instructions below to record and save your demos.


# Instructions #

After SEADS [Installation](Installation.md):
  1. Make sure SEADS is running (an icon will be visible in the tray of a floppy disk.)
  1. Begin playing a Source Engine game (TF2, L4D, Sourceforts, etc.)
  1. To record a demo, press the NUMPAD ENTER key (default).  To start a new demo, press NUMPAD ENTER again.
  1. When you're done, exit the game.
  1. When saving is completed, a window will appear showing how many demos were saved by SEADS.

SEADS must be running to properly organize demos after playing.  If SEADS is not running you can still record demos with NUMPAD ENTER, but they will overwrite any previous demos in the main game folder.  As of version 3.10 users can manually check for demos to save using SEADS in the Configuration Menu.
