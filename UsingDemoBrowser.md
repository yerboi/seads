# Using The Demo Browser #

The Demo Browser allows users to quickly navigate and manipulate demos saved by SEADS.  Added in version 3.20, the Demo Browser gives users the ability to manipulate demo files in multiple ways: users can rename demos, or quickly browse to the containing folder of a demo, or delete multiple demos to the Recycle Bin with a simple interface.  The Demo Browser also allows users to watch a selected demo or convert the demo to a TGA collection or HD AVI.
